# Fullstack Development Final Project

## Description
This is a weather app created as per the third instruction of the project specifications. It can tell the weather according to one's location using a weather API.

## Deployment

### Locally
This project can be deployed locally, and quite simply, by simply installing all the node prerequisites and running the `npm start` command from inside the project directory.

### Using browser once deployed:
Once deployed the web-app will ask for location permission, please grant these in order for it to function as the weather information is location-dependent.
