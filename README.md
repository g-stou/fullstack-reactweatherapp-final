# Fullstack Development Final Project

## Description
This is a weather app created as per the third instruction of the project specifications. It can tell the weather according to one's location using a weather API.

## Deployment

### Locally
This project can be deployed locally, and quite simply, by simply installing all the node prerequisites and running the `npm install` and `npm start` commands from inside the project directory. If you are not sure about the prerequisites they are listed in packages.json.
Note that we also are using the Semantic UI library and moment.

### Using browser once deployed:
Once deployed the web-app will ask for location permission, please grant these in order for it to function as the weather information is location-dependent.
